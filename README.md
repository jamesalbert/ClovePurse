iOS app that shows your current balance of Garlicoin using CoinFalcon's API.

## Getting Started

Clone and cd into this repo and run `yarn run ios` to start the packager and
and iOS simulator. Enter your api key and secret from CoinFalcon and click "refresh".


This is an intro app for /u/jbdawinna, finish it up bruh. See if you can get the
balance with just the wallet address and take out the api key and secret stuff.
